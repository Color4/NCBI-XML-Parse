Targeted PCR for enrichment of cloneIDs on full length cDNA obtained from sample V15
Chromium: Brains were dissected and single cell dissociations prepared using the Papain dissociation system with manual trituration. Purified single cell suspensions were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Visium: Brains were fresh frozen, 10 µm cryosections mounted and fixed on a Visium glass slide +/- immunostaining and libraries prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplicon: full length cDNA obtained during Chromium or Visium library preparation.

    <Title>Cell types and clonal relations in the mouse brain revealed by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics </Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE153424</Accession>
    <Summary>
We report TREX for simultaneous lineage tracking and expression profiling of dissociated cells from the juvenile mouse brain using single cell transcriptomics. We also developed Space-TREX enabling tracking and transcriptome profiling in intact tissue sections via Spatial Transcriptomics.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Lentiviral delivery of a transcribed barcode into neuroepithelial progenitor cells using in utero microinjection into the mouse forebrain at embryonic day 9.5 followed by RNA-seq analysis of barcoded cells at postnatal day 11-14.
